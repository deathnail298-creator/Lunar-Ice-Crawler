07 — Risk Register & Kill Criteria
Lunar Icecrawler — Phase 1
Purpose of This Document

This document does two things:

1️⃣ Identifies the most credible risks to Lunar Icecrawler’s viability
2️⃣ Defines the conditions that terminate the concept honestly

Phase-1 is not about optimism.
Phase-1 is about deciding whether the system should live or die before anyone wastes resources pretending.

If the risks in this document cannot be reasonably mitigated, Phase-1 must conclude with a No-Go.

Risk Philosophy

Lunar Icecrawler deliberately accepts that:

lunar operations are harsh

inefficiency is inevitable

partial success is still success

perfection is unnecessary

But there is a line between:

“hard but survivable”

and

“fundamentally unrealistic.”

This document defines where that line is.

Risk Register (Major Risk Categories)
R1 — Thermal Survivability Failure

Icecrawler may not withstand repeated:

localized heating cycles

thermal gradients

fatigue and expansion effects

Consequence: mission life collapses, heater becomes suicide mechanism.

Phase-1 Attitude:
If heater survival cannot be credibly defended → serious trouble.

R2 — Capture Efficiency Too Low to Matter

Even if heating works, vapor may:

escape to vacuum too easily

refuse to condense effectively

fail to meaningfully accumulate

Consequence: system burns energy for negligible water yield.

Phase-1 Attitude:
If meaningful accumulation cannot be defended → concept may not be worth pursuing.

R3 — Internal Storage Instability

Captured water may:

re-sublimate

structurally destabilize systems

accumulate unpredictably

degrade internal reliability

Consequence: stored mass becomes a liability rather than a resource.

R4 — Unit Formation Unrealistic

Batch formation may prove:

mechanically fragile

inconsistently successful

too susceptible to vacuum sublimation

excessively complex to execute reliably

Consequence: system produces nothing usable.

R5 — Ejection System Fails Over Time

Even if units can form, ejection could:

jam frequently

degrade irrecoverably

impose high precision demands

damage the crawler

Consequence: unsustainable production process.

R6 — Passive Tagging Proves Practically Useless

Tags may:

fail to remain readable

fail to remain attached

fail to meaningfully assist retrieval

demand unrealistic deployment precision

Consequence: retrieval benefit collapses.

R7 — Mobility & Ground Stability Failure

Crawler may:

fail to reach terrain

fail to stabilize during heating

fail to maintain working contact geometry

require exotic locomotion to survive

Consequence: system never truly operates as designed.

R8 — Energy Economics Break the Concept

If energy requirements:

are wildly disproportionate to yield

impose unsustainable operation cycles

require unrealistic power architecture

Consequence: concept becomes pointless no matter how clever.

R9 — Conceptual Fragility / Doctrine Mismatch

If making it “work” demands:

high precision robotics

fragile coordination

unrealistic environmental assumptions

tightly coupled partner systems

Consequence: it violates the core identity of Lunar Icecrawler and loses legitimacy.

Kill Criteria (Honest Stop Conditions)

Phase-1 must recommend No-Go if any of the following become clear:

Kill-1: Heating + Capture Cannot Realistically Produce Meaningful Output

If after sober evaluation reviewers cannot defend:

survivable heater operation

believable vapor capture

legitimate accumulation over time

Then the core architecture fails.

Kill-2: Unit Formation Is Fundamentally Not Plausible

If realistic lunar physics strongly predict:

persistent failure to form usable units, or

unit stability is not survivable,

Then Icecrawler loses its purpose.

Kill-3: Ejection Cannot Be Made Rugged

If ejection demands:

delicate choreography

high precision

constant maintenance

…or obviously will jam catastrophically over time,
the doctrine collapses.

Kill-4: Passive Tagging Becomes Active / Fragile or Pointless

If tagging:

requires power,

requires health,

requires networking,

or does not provide meaningful retrieval value,

…then the philosophical structure of the system fails.

Kill-5: Mobility & Ground Contact Are Not Believable

If reviewers conclude:

stable posture is unrealistic,

site operation is improbable,

contact conditions cannot be trusted,

…then Lunar Icecrawler must be rejected.

Kill-6: Energy Reality Makes It Laughably Inefficient

If Phase-1 determines:

energy-to-yield is so disproportionate that mission value collapses,

Then no amount of optimism can save the concept.

Kill-7: System Requires Fantasy Engineering

If success depends on:

ideal terrain

ideal sealing

ideal capture

miraculous hardware longevity

precision robotics incompatible with doctrine

Then the concept is fundamentally dishonest.
Phase-1 should kill it.

Graceful Survival Rule

If risks remain but reviewers can argue that:

degraded performance still produces useful output

partial mission success still has value

risks appear manageable rather than terminal

Then the system deserves to continue.

Evaluation Outcome Rule

Phase-1 proceeds ONLY IF reviewers can defend that:

no kill condition is clearly triggered

major risks appear harsh but survivable

Lunar Icecrawler remains philosophically and operationally coherent

If reviewers cannot do so honestly:

Phase-1 No-Go — Concept does not justify further development.

If reviewers can do so honestly:

Phase-1 continues. Risks acknowledged, but concept remains viable.

Either result counts as success, because the process delivered truth.
