05 — Passive Tagging Practicality
Lunar Icecrawler — Phase 1
Purpose of This Document

This document determines whether Lunar Icecrawler’s passive tagging doctrine is realistically achievable, durable, and operationally useful.

If tagging turns out to require fragile electronics, unrealistic precision, constant maintenance, or fantasy reliability, then the tagging pillar collapses and Phase 1 must be prepared to stop honestly.

Phase 1 is about practicality, not cleverness.

Core Question

Phase 1 must answer:

“Can Lunar Icecrawler reliably place durable, passive identification tags on ejected resource units in a way that is mechanically believable, operationally useful, and mission-resilient?”

If the answer leans no, Lunar Icecrawler loses credibility.

Tagging Philosophy

Tagging is not a tech flex.
Tagging is logistics sanity.

Doctrine is:

tagging must be passive

tagging must be durable

tagging must be independent from ejection mechanics

tagging must not create new system dependencies

tagging failure must never kill the overall mission value

The tag exists to say:

“This is one of ours.
This object is intentional.
You can find it and retrieve it later.”

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

Functional Requirements for Tags

To remain credible, tags must:

1️⃣ Survive lunar thermal & dust environment
2️⃣ Require no power, no radio health, no maintenance
3️⃣ Be machinable / deployable by a slow rugged robot
4️⃣ Remain readable or recognizable over realistic mission timescales
5️⃣ Allow another system to:

find units,

confirm identity,

retrieve confidently

If tags cannot realistically satisfy that role, the doctrine collapses.

Acceptable Tag Implementations (Concept-Class, Not Engineering Spec)

Phase 1 accepts that specific engineering may vary, but plausible implementations could include:

optical fiducial markers / visible geometry tags

durable shape or symbol

camera-identifiable

dust-tolerant with smart CV processing

passive RFID / NFC-like structures

only readable when retrieval asset is close

no internal power

purely convenience, not dependency

mechanical identification markers

etched plates

stamped plates

simple durable marker embedded into or attached to the unit

Phase 1 does NOT pick a winner.
Phase 1 demands that at least one of these categories remains credible.

What Tagging MUST NOT Become

Tagging must NOT drift into:

active beacons

blinking lights

powered electronics health dependencies

communication networks

live status tracking systems

fragile alignment choreography

precision robotics drama

If tagging requires those things, Lunar Icecrawler breaks doctrine and credibility.

Mechanical Deployment Realism

Tagging deployment must be:

simple

repeatable

tolerant of dust

tolerant of rough ejection variability

independent of exact unit geometry

separable from ejection failure modes

It should feel like:

“industrial stapler for the Moon”

Not:

“delicate laboratory instrument operating perfectly in hell.”

If tagging requires high finesse, Phase 1 needs to call No-Go.

Operational Usefulness Requirement

Tags are only justified if they actually deliver value:

help retrieval assets locate resource units without fantasy assumptions

allow confirmation that a found object is Icecrawler-produced

enable mapping or documentation after the fact

reduce search burden and risk

If tags cannot meaningfully reduce retrieval cost and uncertainty, they are unnecessary complexity — and Phase 1 should reject them.

Failure Modes We Accept

Phase 1 honestly accepts that tagging may experience:

occasional deployment failure

damaged or partially readable tags

dust coverage reducing efficiency

mechanical wear reducing reliability over time

variability in readability

rare untagged units that must simply be ignored or manually identified

These do not kill the mission if most units are still properly tagged.

Failure Modes That Kill the Concept

Tagging is unacceptable if:

tags routinely fail to remain attached

tags cannot be realistically read in field conditions

tags significantly complicate unit eject design

tagging introduces critical reliability dependencies

tags have to be “alive” to remain useful

tags clearly won’t survive lunar conditions

If this becomes the honest conclusion, Phase 1 must call No-Go here.

Compatibility With Doctrine

Tagging must reinforce the system’s identity:

slow

rugged

boring

predictable

persistent

independent

If tagging feels like:

fragile,

tech-showcase,

clever for its own sake…

…it violates doctrine and loses legitimacy.

Phase 1 Evaluation Outcome Rule

Phase 1 continues ONLY IF reviewers can assert:

passive tags are physically plausible and survivable

deployment mechanisms can remain simple and rugged

tagging aligns with Lunar Icecrawler doctrine

tagging clearly provides real operational value

failure does not collapse the system

nothing about tagging requires fantasy engineering

If reviewers cannot defend those statements honestly:

Phase 1 No-Go — Passive tagging not credible.

If reviewers can defend them:

Phase 1 continues. Tagging doctrine remains viable.

Either conclusion is success if it is honest.
