# **Phase 0 & Phase 1 License — Free Until Commercialization**

**Applies to:  Lunar-Ice-Crawler

---

## **Purpose & Philosophy**

Phase 0 and Phase 1 exist to **spread ideas, enable experimentation, and support real engineering thinking** without legal fear.

You are encouraged to:

* read
* study
* analyze
* share
* prototype
* test

You do **not** pay for thinking, learning, experimenting, research, or early proof concepts.

You only pay when Lunar-Ice-Crawler becomes:

* real
* operationally deployed
* monetized
* institutionalized

---

## ✅ **You MAY (Without Permission or Payment)**

You are free to:

* Read, analyze, and discuss
* Share privately or publicly
* Use in academic, research, or nonprofit work
* Use in internal corporate research
* Build prototypes
* Conduct laboratory testing
* Conduct **funded research testing**, including government or corporate research programs
* Explore derivative ideas, improvements, and variants

This license intentionally supports **research and development freedom**.

---

## ⛔ **You MAY NOT (Without Paid Execution License)**

You may not:

* Commercialize Lunar-Ice-Crawler or derivatives
* Integrate into paid deliverables, mission systems, or hardware deployments
* Incorporate into government, defense, or commercial operational systems
* Use as part of a paid contract deliverable
* Deploy in any operational, mission, field, production, or real-world environment
* Position Lunar-Ice-Crawler as a product, offering, system capability, or owned institutional asset
* Monetize Lunar-Ice-Crawler in any direct or indirect way

### **Clear Line Definition**

Funded **research, prototyping, and testing = allowed**
Operational deployment, mission integration, institutional adoption, or monetization = **not allowed without license**

If **money, operations, contracts, mission planning, capability ownership, or deployment** enter the picture,
you are past Phase 0 / Phase 1 and you **owe licensing**.

---

## **Derivatives**

You **may** explore and prototype derivative concepts.

However:

* Derivative commercial use
* Derivative operational deployment
* Institutional adoption of derivatives

also **require a paid license**, if substantially based on Lunar-Ice-Crawler.

No “rename it and claim independence” legal games.

---

## **Attribution**

Non-commercial reuse must credit:

Lunar-Ice-Crawler
Attribution must be reasonable and visible in related documents, presentations, research papers, and materials.

---

## **Warranty & Liability**

This material is provided **as conceptual engineering reference only**.

It comes with:

* **No warranty**
* **No guarantee of correctness**
* **No guarantee of safety**
* **No assurance of suitability for mission, flight, or operational environments**

Anyone executing, deploying, or commercializing without license does so **entirely at their own risk**.

---

## **Execution / Commercialization License**

A separate paid license is required for:

* commercialization
* operational deployment
* mission integration
* institutional adoption
* paid productization

Pricing and contractual terms are defined in Phase 3.

---

## **Termination & Enforcement**

Violation of this license:

* Immediately terminates permission to use
* Requires removal from mission planning, documentation, and systems
* May trigger legal action

License owner retains right to enforce compliance.

---

## **Jurisdiction**

Governing law and venue are the jurisdiction of the license holder unless otherwise contractually agreed in an execution license.

---

## **Plain-English Summary**

Use freely.
Prototype freely.
Test freely.
Even funded research is fine.

The line is not thinking.
The line is not learning.
The line is not experimenting.

The line is:

**Commercialization / Operational Deployment / Institutional Ownership**

Once you cross that line,
pay for the license and do it cleanly.
