02 — System Boundaries & Non-Claims
Lunar Icecrawler
Purpose of This Document

This document formally defines what Lunar Icecrawler is allowed to be, and equally importantly, what it will not claim to be. These constraints prevent scope inflation, unrealistic expectations, and misinterpretation of Phase 0 intent.

If a capability is not explicitly inside the boundaries below, it is not part of this system.

System Boundary — What Lunar Icecrawler Is

Lunar Icecrawler is bounded to the following role:

A contact-based water liberation crawler

That uses heat + controlled capture volume

To extract crude lunar water vapor

Converts that vapor internally into collected crude water

Accumulates water across multiple extraction cycles

Periodically forms a finished resource unit

Ejects that unit

Immediately applies a durable passive retrieval/identity tag

Leaves the unit in the environment

Moves on and repeats

That is the system.

Core Functional Boundary

Lunar Icecrawler is authorized to perform:

Allowed

local traversal and position control

hood/plate/tube contact and sealing behavior

thermal injection into regolith

vapor redirection into internal capture pathway

condensation and crude liquid/ice collection

internal storage accumulation

periodic unit formation and ejection

passive tagging of ejected units

survival-oriented system management

slow, persistent operation over long timelines

Nothing outside that list is assumed.

Explicit Non-Claims

Lunar Icecrawler does NOT:

❌ refine or purify water

❌ chemically process water

❌ store bulk depot volumes

❌ create coordinated cache facilities

❌ perform long-range logistics or transport

❌ do science collection or instrument analysis

❌ perform subsurface drilling campaigns

❌ conduct geological mapping or prospecting

❌ require a partner robot to function

❌ require networking or swarm coordination

❌ depend on fragile digital inventory systems

If someone wants those capabilities, they belong to other systems, not this one.

Tagging Boundary

Lunar Icecrawler only commits to:

placing a passive, durable locator/identity tag

whose job is limited to:

marking the unit as Icecrawler-produced

enabling discovery and visual/ID confirmation later

It does NOT claim:

active radio beacons

long-range tracking networks

powered electronics dependency

continuous “alive” systems

Tagging remains intentionally dumb and survivable.

Environmental Boundary

Lunar Icecrawler is scoped for:

lunar surface operations

vacuum thermal behavior

abrasive regolith environment

cold, thermally volatile terrain

slow, persistent surface operation

It does NOT claim:

Mars optimization

Europa/ice-ocean mission suitability

human EVA co-operation dependence

Earth testing fidelity guarantees beyond Phase 1 scope

Dependency Boundary

Lunar Icecrawler explicitly does not require:

an established logistics network

a refinery already deployed

active retrieval assets in operation

continuous communications

synchronized fleet behavior

It is allowed to operate alone, continuously accumulating tagged resource units whether anyone is picking them up yet or not.

Authority Boundary

No organization deploying Lunar Icecrawler should infer that it:

guarantees mission success

guarantees ISRU viability

guarantees cost savings

guarantees production rates

guarantees consistency across terrain sites

Phase 0 acknowledges reality:
This is a plausible architecture, not a promise.

Failure Boundary

If Lunar Icecrawler partially fails, the system is still considered philosophically valid if:

some units are produced intermittently

tagging still occurs

extraction still occurs somewhere some of the time

The design is not an all-or-nothing hero asset.
It is a “something is better than nothing” appliance.

Scope Guardrail Summary

Lunar Icecrawler is:

A slow, durable, front-end lunar ice liberation and batching crawler that periodically ejects and passively tags crude water resource units for later retrieval.

Anything outside that description is out of bounds for Phase 0.
