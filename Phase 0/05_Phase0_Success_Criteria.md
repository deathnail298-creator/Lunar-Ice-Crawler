05 — Phase 0 Success Criteria
Lunar Icecrawler
Purpose of This Document

Phase 0 exists to answer one question honestly:

“Does Lunar Icecrawler deserve to exist as a concept?”

This document defines the objective criteria for answering yes.
If these conditions cannot be defended, the concept should not proceed.

Phase 0 success does not require proof of engineering feasibility.
It requires proof of conceptual legitimacy, role clarity, and strategic value.

Category 1 — Mission Justification Criteria

Lunar Icecrawler must demonstrate that:

1️⃣ There is a real, recurring problem
Lunar ISRU requires a way to turn identified icy regolith into usable, retrievable material.

2️⃣ The problem is not already sufficiently solved
Existing solutions either:

assume full refineries everywhere,

assume logistics-first architectures,

or skip the messy “liberate, accumulate, batch” phase entirely.

3️⃣ Icecrawler occupies a definable system role
Its lane—contact heating + vapor capture + accumulation + periodic unit ejection—is legitimate and bounded.

Phase-0 Pass Condition:
A clear “missing slot” exists in ISRU architecture, and Lunar Icecrawler cleanly fills it.

Category 2 — Role Discipline Criteria

The concept must prove it is not pretending to be something else.

Lunar Icecrawler must:

avoid drifting into refinery territory

avoid drifting into logistics territory

avoid trying to become a flagship super-system

remain an appliance-class contributor

Phase-0 Pass Condition:
Role definition is stable, disciplined, and not dependent on future fantasy capabilities.

Category 3 — Technical Plausibility Criteria

Phase 0 does not require engineering specs or validated feasibility modeling.

But it does require:

thermal contact extraction is physically plausible

vapor capture + condensation is conceptually reasonable

accumulating crude water internally is realistic

periodic ejection is mechanically imaginable

passive tagging is survivable and rational

If basic physics says “this could work,”
Phase 0 considers that sufficient.

Phase-0 Pass Condition:
No fundamental violations of physics, energy reality, or obvious impossibility.

Category 4 — Operational Philosophy Criteria

Lunar Icecrawler must align with its defined doctrine:

persistence over speed

reliability over cleverness

accumulation over instant gratification

standalone operation without coordination

distributed inventory over centralized dependence

Phase-0 Pass Condition:
Operational philosophy is internally consistent and strengthens the ISRU ecosystem rather than complicating it.

Category 5 — Integration Value Criteria

The system must make the broader lunar architecture better, not worse.

Lunar Icecrawler must:

reduce burden on refining systems

reduce reliance on single heroic infrastructure assets

create value even if downstream logistics are delayed

remain useful across multiple mission phases

contribute resilience instead of fragility

Phase-0 Pass Condition:
ISRU architecture is clearly stronger with Lunar Icecrawler than without it.

Category 6 — Risk Posture Criteria

Lunar Icecrawler’s existence is only justified if:

failure does not collapse mission architecture

partial capability still produces value

conservative operation is acceptable

slow throughput is strategically meaningful

its loss does not cripple the mission

Phase-0 Pass Condition:
The system contributes value without introducing unacceptable systemic risk.

Phase 0 Verdict Rule

Phase 0 is earned, not assumed.

Lunar Icecrawler passes Phase 0 only if reviewers can defensibly conclude:

The problem is real.

The role is necessary.

The concept is physically plausible.

The doctrine is internally coherent.

The architecture is stronger with it.

The risk posture is sane.

If all criteria pass:

Phase-0 Status: Granted — Lunar Icecrawler is justified to exist.

If not, Phase 0 must be failed honestly.
