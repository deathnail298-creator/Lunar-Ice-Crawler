Phase 2 / Phase 3 — Unified Execution License (TEL-1.0)
Plain English Summary

You may freely read Phase 2 and Phase 3 materials.
You may not execute, implement, test, integrate, operationalize, or derive doctrine from Phase 2 or Phase 3 without purchasing a $5,000 Execution License.

One license covers both phases. No tiers. No hidden fees.

1. Free Use

Phase 2 and Phase 3 materials are free to:

read

study

discuss internally

cite, reference, and analyze

No payment is required to simply access or review the content.

2. Execution Requires a Paid License

You must purchase a single $5,000 Execution License before performing any of the following with Phase 2 or Phase 3:

“Execution” includes, but is not limited to:

building or fabricating any system described

prototyping or testing in any environment

integrating into any mission, platform, product, or program

use in labs, field tests, engineering evaluations, or simulations with intent to implement

deriving operational doctrine, procedures, or operational policy

incorporating Phase 2 or Phase 3 content into internal systems, deliverables, proposals, or customer work

governmental, commercial, academic, or private execution

If you’re doing something real with it, not just reading it — that is execution.

3. One License Covers Phase 2 AND Phase 3

The $5,000 Execution License grants:

Phase 2 Execution ✔️

Phase 3 Execution ✔️

No separate payment. No follow-on fees. No escalation.

One organization. One right to execute. $5,000 total.

4. Scope of License

This license grants your organization:

permission to execute Phase 2 and Phase 3

permission to adapt and modify internally

permission to field or operate implementations

This license does not:

transfer ownership, authorship, or copyright

grant exclusivity

grant sublicensing rights

5. Phase 0 / Phase 1 Clarification

Phase 0 and Phase 1 remain:

free to read

free to test

free to prototype

non-commercial only

Commercialization of Phase 0 / Phase 1 requires a separate commercial agreement.

6. No License = No Execution

If you do not hold a valid Execution License:

you may read Phase 2 and Phase 3

you may not execute Phase 2 or Phase 3

“partial prototype” still counts as execution

“internal testing only” still counts as execution

“research use” still counts as execution

There are no loopholes.
Execution requires a license.

7. Price

Execution License:
$5,000 USD (one-time, per organization)
