Drift.md — Doctrine Integrity

Moon Ice Crawler — Phase 3

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines doctrine drift during Phase-3 execution and establishes hard guardrails to prevent:

slow erosion of safety

political reshaping of mission reality

quiet shortcuts

silent normalization of risk

governance collapse disguised as “efficiency”

Phase-3 only works if the execution doctrine remains intact, disciplined, and enforced.

2. What Drift Is

Drift is not loud.
It is not dramatic.
It rarely looks reckless in the moment.

Drift is:

“just this once”

“it’ll be fine”

“we don’t need to do that anymore”

“we’ll fix it later”

“leadership wants this number bigger”

Drift turns safe execution into gambling.

3. Sources of Drift We Expect
3.1 Stakeholder & Political Drift

Pressure will come from:

schedule urgency

publicity demands

optics management

executive impatience

budget justification narratives

This creates:

unrealistic expectations

pressure to bypass guardrails

pressure to overclaim capability

3.2 Engineering Optimism Drift

Talented engineers often believe:

they can out-smart uncertainty

simulations equal reality

constraints are “overly conservative”

This leads to:

quiet limit loosening

“we’ll just tune it on the fly” thinking

replacing safety doctrine with faith in cleverness

3.3 Operational Shortcuts Drift

Operational teams under time pressure naturally try to:

skip slow steps

automate responsibility away

streamline governance instead of respecting it

This leads to:

checklist erosion

undocumented “tribal procedures”

execution deviation without recorded intent

3.4 Institutional Forgetting

Even disciplined programs degrade due to:

personnel turnover

memory loss

policy documents being ignored

leadership resets

Doctrine must be preserved explicitly — not orally and not culturally.

4. Red-Line Areas Where Drift Is Forbidden

Drift is absolutely not permitted in the following domains:

1️⃣ Safety Doctrine
2️⃣ Execution Governance Authority Boundaries
3️⃣ Risk Posture & Failure Behavior Rules
4️⃣ Communications Failure Behavior Defaults
5️⃣ Planetary Protection & Ethical Boundaries

If drift is identified in any of these categories:

The crawler halts operational tempo until doctrine integrity is restored.

No debate. No “contextual exceptions.” No executive override.

5. Drift Detection

Drift must be treated as a monitored failure mode.

Detection mechanisms:

Mandatory periodic doctrine review

Governance compliance checks

Operational behavior audits

Telemetry & log compliance verification

Independent oversight body empowered to say “stop”

If a team cannot prove they are following doctrine, the assumption is:

They are not following doctrine.

Burden of proof lies with operators, not auditors.

6. Drift Response Protocol

When drift is suspected or confirmed:

1️⃣ Immediate Pause
Relevant operations slow or stop — safety first.

2️⃣ Assessment
Review:

what changed

why it changed

whether the change was intentional or accidental

3️⃣ Decision
One of three outcomes:

Doctrine reaffirmed; operations resume

Doctrine updated formally (documented + approved)

Operations remain restricted and leadership is notified

4️⃣ Permanent Record
Any doctrine adjustment must:

be written

be archived

be transparent

explicitly name risk tradeoffs

Undocumented doctrine change = organizational malpractice.

7. Doctrine Change Is Allowed — But Only Honestly

Phase-3 doctrine is not religious dogma.
It can evolve — but only under disciplined process.

Rules for legitimate doctrine change:

must be deliberate

must be written

must be approved by governance authority

must explicitly state why the old doctrine was wrong

must define new risk posture

must be publicly accountable within the mission ecosystem

If a change cannot survive written scrutiny, it is drift — not evolution.

8. Drift Kill Conditions

If drift becomes systemic or leadership refuses correction:

Crawler is pulled from mission-critical dependence

Operational role is downgraded or suspended

Program leadership must be replaced or reset

The crawler is infrastructure, not a casino chip.
If the culture cannot execute safely, the program does not deserve trust.

9. Drift Success Criteria

Drift management is successful when:

Doctrine remains recognizable between early and late Phase-3

No silent policy erosion occurs

Execution behavior remains consistent

Governance remains real instead of symbolic

Leadership cannot quietly override safety doctrine

Teams trust doctrine instead of fighting it

When someone asks years later:
“Is this still the same disciplined crawler program?”
The answer should credibly be:
Yes.
