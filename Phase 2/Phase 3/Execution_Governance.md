Moon Ice Crawler — Phase 3

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines who has authority, who does not, and how execution decisions are governed once the Moon Ice Crawler is in operational reality.

Governance prevents:

uncontrolled decision-making

quiet authority creep

safety doctrine erosion

“we just decided in the room” failures

blurred accountability

Execution governance exists so the crawler operates like a professionally-run infrastructure asset, not a hobby project.

2. Governance Philosophy

Execution governance is built on three principles:

1️⃣ Authority must be explicit, not implied
2️⃣ Responsibility must be owned, not diffused
3️⃣ Safety and discipline outrank schedule and politics

If governance is vague, reality will exploit it.
Phase-3 eliminates vagueness.

3. Governance Structure

A credible program requires clear vertical responsibility:

3.1 Governance Layers

Layer 1 — Strategic Authority (Program Leadership)
Owns:

mission alignment

final accountability

approval of doctrine changes

red-line risk decisions

Cannot:

micromanage operations

override safety doctrine casually

authorize reckless shortcuts

Layer 2 — Operational Authority (Operations Command)
Owns:

daily crawler operations

execution discipline

adherence to doctrine

final say on “go / no-go” decisions for active runs

Cannot:

waive governance

ignore risk doctrine

bow to political pressure

silently redefine procedures

Layer 3 — Technical Authority (Engineering Oversight)
Owns:

system understanding

technical advisories

reliability advice

safety assessments

Has influence, not unchecked control.
Engineering informs, it does not override operational or strategic governance.

Layer 4 — Independent Oversight
Owns:

compliance audits

doctrine integrity checks

drift monitoring

whistleblower safety

Purpose: ensure the system does not lie to itself.

4. Decision Authority Definition
4.1 Who Can Authorize What

Operational Execution Decisions

Owned by Operations Command

Safety Hold Decisions

Any authorized safety officer

Any governance-empowered operator

Oversight body if unresolved disagreements exist

If someone says stop, the crawler stops.
Disagreement is resolved after safety is secured, not before.

Doctrine Changes

Only Strategic Authority may approve

Must be written, reviewed, documented, archived

Must include risk justification

No informal doctrine change is valid.
If it isn’t written, it does not exist.

Mission Repositioning / Repurposing

Requires Strategic Authority approval

Must include operations, engineering, and oversight sign-off

No “quiet pivoting.”

5. Governance Responsibilities
5.1 Strategic Authority Responsibilities

Must:

preserve program integrity

reject PR-driven recklessness

enforce budgeting discipline

refuse normalization of deviance

maintain accountability visibility

If Strategic Authority collapses, the program collapses.

5.2 Operational Command Responsibilities

Must:

execute conservatively

follow doctrine consistently

report deviations honestly

protect operators from political pressure

prioritize safe reliability over production numbers

Operational Command runs the machine — and defends its safety.

5.3 Engineering Responsibilities

Must:

provide grounded truth, not optimism bias

admit uncertainty

declare failures honestly

support operators rather than challenge discipline

oppose unsafe pushes with technical authority

Engineering exists to defend reality.

5.4 Oversight Responsibilities

Must:

audit without fear

carry authority to halt

protect doctrine integrity

publish honest findings internally

Oversight without power is theater.
Phase-3 assumes real oversight power exists.

6. Escalation Model

Escalation must be disciplined, not political.

6.1 Normal Escalation

1️⃣ Operator identifies concern
2️⃣ Operational Command evaluates
3️⃣ Engineering provides assessment
4️⃣ Strategic Authority resolves if needed

Document everything.

6.2 Safety Escalation

1️⃣ Immediate halt
2️⃣ Safety case review
3️⃣ Root cause analysis
4️⃣ Formal resolution
5️⃣ Restart only when justified

Safety escalation has zero tolerance for politics.

6.3 Governance Conflict Resolution

If governance authorities disagree:

Oversight body arbitrates OR

higher tier resolves formally

No unresolved disputes while the crawler continues experimenting.

7. Governance Failure Conditions

Governance has failed if:

decisions happen off-record

“verbal approvals” replace written authority

safety holds are discouraged

leadership pressures execution dishonestly

audit findings are ignored

undocumented policy drift accumulates

If any of these are detected, program trust is suspended until corrected.

8. Governance Transparency Expectations

A healthy execution ecosystem includes:

written governance logs

decision journals

risk deliberation records

visible accountability

openness to internal scrutiny

Hidden governance is failed governance.

9. Governance Success Criteria

Governance is successful when:

authority is clear and respected

safety doctrine can’t be overridden casually

execution decisions are calm and disciplined

operators trust leadership

leadership trusts governance

oversight trusts data

stakeholders trust the program

When something fails, the conversation should never be:
“Who was actually responsible?”
It should be obvious.
