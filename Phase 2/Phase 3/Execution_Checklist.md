Phase_3_Execution_Checklist.md

Moon Ice Crawler — Phase 3

Purpose

This checklist exists to force discipline before and during Phase-3 execution.

It prevents:

quiet compromises

governance drift

rushed deployment

“we’ll be fine” optimism

If an item cannot be honestly checked, operations do not proceed.
No negotiation. No political override. No spin.

✅ PHASE-3 EXECUTION CHECKLIST
1️⃣ Pre-Execution Governance Readiness

Governance Structure

 Strategic Authority identified and active

 Operations Command established

 Engineering Oversight defined

 Independent Oversight empowered

Authority Clarity

 Written governance responsibilities acknowledged

 Written escalation rules in effect

 STOP authority confirmed (any authorized safety role can halt operations)

Doctrine Integrity

 Drift controls active

 Governance logs in place

 Doctrine review cadence established

If governance is theoretical or symbolic → STOP

2️⃣ System Acceptance Status

Validation Completed

 Technical validation complete

 Operational validation complete

 Governance & doctrine validation complete

Formal Acceptance

 Strategic Authority signed

 Operations Command signed

 Technical Authority signed

 Independent Oversight signed

Anything short of full acceptance → STOP

3️⃣ Operational Readiness

Operators

 trained

 certified

 rehearsed with real procedures

 familiar with abort doctrine

 psychologically safe to halt operations without retaliation

Procedures

 startup checklist proven

 extraction cycle checklist proven

 transfer checklist proven

 abort procedures drilled

 comms failure drills completed

If execution relies on improvisation → STOP

4️⃣ Environment & Integration Readiness

Field Environment

 defined operating zone

 safe distance rules approved

 traffic coordination established

Dependencies

 upstream tasking authority functional

 downstream receiver ready

 recharge / logistics chain reliable

If integration is hypothetical → STOP

5️⃣ Technical & Safety Readiness

Boundaries Enforced

 thermal limits proven

 pressure limits proven

 safe defaults tested

 abort transitions tested

 comms-loss safety behavior verified

Risk Reality

 no unresolved catastrophic-risk class issues

 no reliance on luck

 unacceptable risk list reviewed and enforced

If safety relies on faith → STOP

6️⃣ Communications & Transparency Readiness

Comms

 baseline link stable enough

 degraded mode defined

 total failure behavior confirmed

Transparency

 logging discipline ready

 oversight access guaranteed

 leadership accepts honesty over optics

If transparency can’t survive reality → STOP

🚀 Execution Greenlight Conditions

Phase-3 execution may proceed only when:

 Governance real

 Acceptance proven

 Operators ready

 Integration real

 Safety demonstrated

 Communications controlled

 Transparency enforced

If ANY box cannot be honestly checked,
the correct decision is:

Do Not Execute. Fix First. Then Proceed.

Failure During Execution

If failure occurs after execution begins:

 Stop

 Safe state confirmed

 Governance notified

 Oversight engaged

 Root cause investigated

 Doctrine compliance verified

 Only restart if justified

If failure requires PR management → governance already failed.

Success Criteria

This checklist succeeded if:

execution feels calm, justified, disciplined

no one gambles

governance remains visible and respected

failures remain boring and controlled

leadership sleeps at night

If execution feels like adventure, Phase-3 discipline has collapsed.
