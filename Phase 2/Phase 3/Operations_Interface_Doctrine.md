Moon Ice Crawler — Phase 3

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines how the Moon Ice Crawler interfaces with other systems, mission actors, and operational structures.

It prevents:

turf wars

unclear ownership

operational collisions

dependency chaos

misaligned expectations

The crawler is not alone.
It lives in a broader mission ecosystem.
That ecosystem requires disciplined coordination.

2. Interface Philosophy

Three truths govern interface behavior:

1️⃣ The crawler is a supporting infrastructure node — not the mission center of gravity
2️⃣ Clear ownership and boundaries prevent operational chaos
3️⃣ Interfaces must be boring, predictable, documented, and respected

If two systems argue about “who actually controls what,”
that is a governance failure — not a technical one.

3. Operational Identity
3.1 Role in the Ecosystem

The Moon Ice Crawler is fundamentally:

a resource conditioning unit

slow

persistent

reliability-focused

It is NOT:

a robotics experiment platform

a hero vehicle

a real-time responsive tool

a “see what happens if we try this” system

It is deliberately unexciting.
That is its strength.

4. Organizational Interfaces

Operations require explicit, well-defined relationships.

4.1 Upstream Tasking Authority

Defines:

where the crawler works

when it works

how it is prioritized

long-horizon mission planning alignment

Upstream tasking does NOT:

micromanage operations

override doctrine

push unsafe objectives

Authority sits above operations, not inside them.

4.2 Downstream Receiving Systems

These include:

storage tanks

ISRU processing systems

logistics chains

mission utilization endpoints

Interface expectations:

crawler provides conditioned resource at predictable cadence

receiver confirms readiness and capacity

neither side assumes the other “will figure it out”

The crawler does not run unless its receiver chain is ready.
Receiver chains do not assume crawler output entitlement.

4.3 Base Operations

Base operations control:

zone safety

ground traffic management

environmental coordination

proximity clearance rules

crew interaction policies

Base operations outrank crawler execution when safety or coordination dictates.
If base control says stop → crawler stops.
No debate.

4.4 Engineering & Maintenance

Interface assumptions:

engineering informs, does not command

maintenance policies respect governance approvals

any configuration change is documented

no “field hacks”

Engineering and maintenance are service functions supporting stability,
not innovation engines mid-operation.

4.5 Independent Oversight

Oversight has:

audit access

authority visibility

incident investigation priority

ability to halt if doctrine violation exists

Oversight is NOT optional.
Oversight does NOT need permission to speak.

5. Communications Interfaces

Operations require layered comms expectations:

baseline communications for telemetry & command

degraded comms operational rules

comms loss safe-state enforcement

shared reporting pathways with other systems

No dependency assumes perfect communications.

If another system needs crawler comms to behave predictably,
that dependency must be documented — not assumed.

6. Physical Interface Doctrine
6.1 Operating Zones

Crawler respects:

defined work boundaries

proximity rules

hazard radius constraints

routing discipline

If the crawler needs to leave its defined area,
that requires governance acknowledgment — not improvisation.

6.2 Crew Interaction

Default assumption:

crew avoids crawler operating area

crawler does not operate near humans unless explicitly approved

zero ambiguity between “crew zone” and “crawler zone”

If a system puts crew and crawler too close without discipline,
the crawler yields and stops.

Human safety beats crawler productivity.

6.3 Asset Interaction Rules

Crawler will not:

operate in tight proximity to high-value mission assets without controls

assume priority over other vehicles

interfere with or obstruct base operations pathways

If conflict appears:

base operations wins

safety wins

crawler waits

Always.

7. Information Interface Doctrine

Operational truth must flow:

crawler logs available to mission reporting channels

status visible to decision makers

performance transparency maintained

anomaly signals shared appropriately

Forbidden:

siloing knowledge

selective truth

overprotective “need-to-know” hiding failure risk

A crawler hiding reality places the mission at risk.

8. Decision Boundary Clarity

Clear boundaries prevent turf fights.

Operations Command owns crawler execution decisions

Upstream Tasking owns production objectives

Base Operations owns environmental and safety space

Engineering owns technical understanding

Oversight owns doctrine integrity

Strategic Authority owns final accountability

If a decision crosses boundaries,
the boundary owners must align in writing — not verbally.

9. Conflict Resolution Rules

Conflicts are inevitable.
Chaos is optional.

Resolution hierarchy:

1️⃣ Safety
2️⃣ Governance
3️⃣ Mission Stability
4️⃣ Production Output

If a decision favors output over the first three,
it is the wrong decision.

🔟 Interface Failure Doctrine

If interface dysfunction appears:

missed expectations

friction between teams

repeated coordination failures

authority confusion

Required response:
1️⃣ Stop operations if needed
2️⃣ Diagnose boundary or authority failure
3️⃣ Document new clarity
4️⃣ Resume only under fixed doctrine

No slow cultural compromise.
Interfaces must remain sharp.

11. Interface Success Criteria

Operations interface doctrine is successful when:

no one is confused who does what

the crawler is predictable and easy to integrate

other systems trust it

base operations do not see it as a problem

governance remains visible

coordination does not feel political

the crawler behaves like a quiet, dependable utility asset

If the crawler creates friction, politics, or confusion,
Phase-3 interface doctrine failed.
