05 — Phase 2 Success Criteria

Moon Ice Crawler — Phase 2

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines what “Phase-2 is complete” actually means for the Moon Ice Crawler.

This phase is not about hype, momentum, or “we’ve thought about it a lot so it must be good.”
Phase-2 is only complete when the system has been reasoned into a disciplined, credible architectural position — or responsibly walked to a stop if reality kills it.

This section prevents fake completion.

2. What Phase-2 Is Supposed to Achieve

Phase-2 exists to:

Turn a plausible idea into a coherent system architecture

Prove the crawler makes sense inside a lunar ISRU ecosystem

Show it can:

fail safely

degrade gracefully

integrate without drama

Identify risks honestly

Provide decision-makers the clarity to say:

“Proceed to engineering” or

“Stop, this doesn’t deserve resources.”

Either outcome is success.

3. Requirements for Phase-2 Completion

Phase-2 is considered successfully completed when the following are true:

3.1 Architecture Coherence Confirmed

System breakdown into subsystems is clear and stable

Interfaces between subsystems are defined at a theory level

Internal data, fluid, mechanical, and control flows make sense

There is no hidden magic or “hand-wave zones”

If a subsystem only works because “engineering will figure it out,” Phase-2 is not done.

3.2 Integration Reality Confirmed

The crawler must fit into a real mission, not an imaginary one.

Completion requires:

Defined upstream tasking authority

Defined downstream receiver of collected water

Operational doctrine that does not require fantasy autonomy

Communications model that tolerates failure

No dependence on:

continuous teleoperation

hero operators

unstable mission behaviors

If integration reads like sci-fi, Phase-2 is not done.

3.3 Reliability & Failure Behavior Credibly Understood

We must have:

A clear degradation ladder

Benign failure expectations

Mission-ending-but-safe failure paths

Unacceptable failures clearly marked

Safe default behaviors locked

If the system could still surprise mission planners in dangerous ways, Phase-2 is not done.

3.4 Risk Register Is Honest and Actionable

Phase-2 is only complete when:

Environmental realities are acknowledged

Mechanical and thermal risks are stated without spin

Programmatic and dependency risks are admitted

Red-line / kill-conditions are explicitly defined

If the risk section reads like marketing, Phase-2 has failed.

3.5 No Critical Dependencies on Fantasy Assumptions

Phase-2 must NOT depend on:

miracle power availability

miracle heater efficiency

miracle autonomy

miracle policy alignment

“crew will just fix it” thinking

If any core requirement relies on unjustified optimism, Phase-2 is not complete.

3.6 Phase-3 Would Be Justified or Justifiably Denied

At the end of Phase-2, mission stakeholders must be able to clearly answer:

Does this crawler deserve engineering resources?

Is there enough architectural confidence to proceed?

Or has Phase-2 revealed that it should stop?

The deliverable is clarity, not a guarantee of progression.

If the decision feels political, emotional, or vague rather than grounded, Phase-2 is not complete.

4. Phase-2 “Definition of Done” Checklist

Phase-2 is done when all are true:

 System architecture theory is internally consistent

 Integration doctrine is grounded in reality

 Communications and operational roles are sensible

 Reliability posture is conservative and credible

 Failure behavior is predictable and safe

 Graceful degradation expectations are set

 Risk register is blunt and useful

 Red-line kill conditions exist and make sense

 Stakeholders can make a confident proceed / don’t proceed decision

If any of these cannot be checked honestly, Phase-2 is incomplete.

5. Success Means Discipline, Not Overconfidence

Phase-2 success is not:

“we think it’ll work”

“we’re excited”

“this is innovative”

“people like the idea”

Phase-2 success is:

The system is understandable

The risks are honest

The integration is believable

The failure paths are safe

The decision to continue (or stop) is grounded, not emotional

If those standards are met, Phase-2 did its job.
