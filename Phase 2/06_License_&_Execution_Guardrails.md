06 — License & Execution Guardrails

Moon Ice Crawler — Phase 2

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the legal and operational boundaries for Phase-2 materials.

Phase-2 exists so people can:

read

think

analyze

critique

evaluate feasibility

Phase-2 does NOT authorize execution.
This section prevents “we thought about it so now we’re building it” behavior.

2. Nature of Phase-2 Content

Phase-2 materials are:

theory

architecture framing

structured reasoning

conceptual design logic

risk and integration analysis

They are not engineering drawings.
They are not build instructions.
They are not TRL claims.
They are not an operational authorization.

Phase-2 is thinking.
Execution lives elsewhere.

3. Licensing Position

Phase-2 materials are provided for:

reading

learning

evaluation

internal study

non-commercial conceptual exploration

Organizations, researchers, agencies, contractors, and hobbyists may:

copy for review

discuss

reference

critique

use as input for analysis

incorporate into non-commercial theoretical work

They may NOT, without a separate execution license:

build

test

field

commercially deploy

integrate into funded mission hardware

incorporate into commercial proposals, bids, or deliverables as executable design

Thinking is free.
Execution is licensed.

4. Execution Prohibition in Phase-2

Phase-2 explicitly prohibits:

Fabrication of hardware based on these materials

Software development intended for direct deployment

Prototyping intended for mission demonstration

Operational field trials

Commercial derivative builds based on this architecture

If you want to build, you need:

A Phase-3 execution license

Explicit authorization covering:

implementation

hardware design rights

liability and responsibility boundaries

commercial or institutional usage rights

No license → no execution.

5. Responsibility & Liability Boundaries

Phase-2 authors/contributors do not accept liability for:

engineering failures

mission failures

financial losses

safety risks

regulatory conflicts

systems derived from Phase-2 content

If someone chooses to execute without authorization, that choice and risk belong entirely to them.

6. Derivative Works

You may:

create theoretical derivative studies

propose alternative architectures

critique or extend conceptual logic (non-commercial)

use portions for educational material with attribution

You may not:

create build-ready derivatives for mission execution

commercialize derivative hardware

incorporate Phase-2 assets into paid deliverables

submit proposals to agencies using this as implicit executable design
…without an execution license.

7. Execution Gatekeeping

Before any entity proceeds to implementation, they must:

1️⃣ Explicitly acknowledge Phase-2 limitations
2️⃣ Secure a Phase-3 Execution License
3️⃣ Demonstrate:

credible downstream integration partner

credible engineering ownership plan

credible safety governance

4️⃣ Accept:

legal

ethical

operational responsibility

No entity gains implied permission because:

they like the idea

they’re “doing it for science”

it seems obvious

they assume “open concept = open execution”

It doesn’t.

8. Institutional & Government Use

Government agencies, national programs, universities, and space institutions may:

study

analyze

reference

include in concept research

They may not:

field

prototype

integrate into funded mission development

treat Phase-2 as approved engineering source

without securing an execution license or written authorization.

9. Ethical Guardrails

If implementation someday occurs, execution must:

comply with planetary protection doctrine

comply with mission safety practices

comply with relevant space law frameworks

avoid irresponsible “hacky deployment”

Phase-2 explicitly rejects:

irresponsible deployment

unreviewed execution

PR stunt construction

“garage build going to space”

If someone wants to do this, they must do it right, not fast.

10. Phase-2 Completion vs Execution Permission

When Phase-2 is complete, it means:

the thinking is solid

the architecture is credible

risks are understood

It does not mean:

“greenlight to build”

“implicit endorsement”

“this is ready to fabricate”

“this is mission approved”

Completion = clarity.
Execution = separate decision, separate license.

11. Guardrail Success Criteria

This licensing and execution doctrine is considered valid if:

Phase-2 remains safely non-executable

Organizations cannot plausibly pretend ambiguity

Thinking remains free and open

Execution requires deliberate governance

Nobody can claim they “accidentally” thought Phase-2 meant go-build

If all of that holds, this section did its job.
